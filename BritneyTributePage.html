            <h2>The #FreeBritney Movement:</h2>
        </div>
        <p>In 2008, American singer Britney Spears was involuntarily placed on a three-day psychiatric hold two separate times.
        At the time, she had been experiencing conflicts in her personal life, including her divorce from Kevin Federline, shaving her head, attacking paparazzi, and losing custody of her two sons with Federline.
        Following the second hold, Spears's father, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Spears">James "Jamie" Spears</a>, filed a petition to institute a temporary conservatorship of Spears, which was made permanent that same year.
        Jamie served as the conservator of Spears's personal affairs as well as co-conservator of her finances.</p>

            <h3>What is a Conservatorship?</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Conservatorship is a legal status to which a court appoints a person to manage the financial and personal affairs of a minor or incapacitated person. 
        A conservator may also serve as a guardian who is responsible for establishing and monitoring the physical care of the individual and managing their living arrangements.

        <h2>Abuse To Advocacy:</h2>
        <div>
            <p>It is possible that members of her family are sincere when they say that they hoped this was a temporary measure put in place until she regained control of her emotions and impulses. 
            But more than a decade later, it has become clear that this is a system that is working well for everyone except the very person it is purported to protect.</p>
            <p>When Spears spoke before a judge two months ago, she voiced shocking accusations regarding her treatment. 
            According to Spears, she was not allowed to remove her IUD, was put on medications she said she does not need and expressed deep resentment for everyone complicit in this conservatorship.
